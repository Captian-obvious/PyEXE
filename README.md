<h1>PyEXE</h1>
<h3>PyEXE is a framework used by PyOS Linux to allow it to run python scripts directly from the desktop.</h3>
PyEXE is a similar framework to .NET but has the unique advantage of being built-in to PyOS Linux and can create a plain executable with simply the --build parameter.<br>
Main Features include:
<ul>
    <li>Built-in to PyOS Linux.</li>
    <li>Versatile and Lightweight</li>
    <li>Can generate executables from python scripts with the --build parameter</li>
    <li>Simple to use, just drop a .py file onto the desktop of PyOS Linux and PyEXE will run it like a program.</li>
</ul>
<h2>I do not plan on making this a standalone package. It will remain exclusive to PyOS Linux</h2>
<em>This project is a WIP, it is not finished</em>
